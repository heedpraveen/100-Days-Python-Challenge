PRINT()
print('Hello Praveen!') -> The print statement used to print the desired message on the screen that is inside quotes. It also prints other type.

New line (\n)
print('Hello Praveen!\nHow are you') -> It prints the following string in the next line.

Concatenate (+)
print('Hello ' + 'Praveen') -> It is used to combine the strings.

Input()
input() -> It is used to get input from users.

Variable
name = 'Praveen' -> By using {name} it allows the value (Praveen) to be accessible globally.

Commant (#)
#test -> Python comments are ignored by the Python interpreter, and are used to explain code, make code more readable, and prevent execution when testing code. 

On using above learned concept, I made my first project, simple band name generator.
